1. There are a number of similarities between my console and the ancient TTY subsystem.  Our console is built in a similar psuedo termanial fashion with 
more power being given to the user making it more flexible.  The process by which the TTY subsystem runs is also almost identical to the process that our console runs.
Both process follow the Linux approach where there is a run queue, an interruptable sleep and a zombie process.  Lastly the ancient TTY subsystem is a kernel driven
structure exactly like how our console is.
